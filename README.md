## Goal
Goal is to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not. For each in the test set, you must predict a 0 or 1 value for the variable.

## Metric
Find the accuracy scores of the models used.

## Submission File Format
A CSV file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. 

### Format of CSV file
The file should have exactly 2 columns:

PassengerId (sorted in any order)
Survived (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)
PassengerId,Survived
 892,0
 893,1
 894,0
 Etc.

## Getting Started

The data set given is in Json format. Data set is comprised of review.json file containing 600000 reviews, the objective of the assignment is to classify the reviews as positive negative and neutral. Along with that predict the required data. 

For this project, I have used 4 classifiers.
1. Naive Byes
2. Random Forest
3. Knn
4. SVM
