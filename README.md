## Goal
Goal is to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not. For each in the test set, you must predict a 0 or 1 value for the variable.

## Metric
Find the accuracy scores of the models used.

## Submission File Format
A CSV file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. 

### Format of CSV file
The file should have exactly 2 columns:

PassengerId (sorted in any order)
Survived (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)
PassengerId,Survived
 892,0
 893,1
 894,0
 Etc.
